# Chip Design and Graph Representation

## Introduction

Chips are key components of many applications and tools, from mobile phones to self-driving cars. Chip design involves defining the product requirements for a chip's architecture and system, as well as the physical layout of the chip's individual circuits, a task which is becoming increasingly challenging as these technologies continue to develop.  Due to Mooreâ€™s Law, rising complexity is pushing the limits of existing chip design techniques, and machine learning offers a possible avenue to new progress. One specific area where chip designers face problems is congestion; often there are certain areas in a chip through which large amounts of information must pass, creating bottlenecks and reducing efficiency. Although electronic design automation tools have been useful to ensure scalability, reliability and time to market, our group aims to improve the process by exploring self-supervised learning techniques that will create useful features to learn effective graph representations to improve performance in predicting congestion and demand.

Given the relatively unexplored domain of machine learning for chip design, many recent attempts have tried to apply tools from different fields, which may not perfectly fit this specific use-case. For example, chip circuits are often represented as graphs in machine learning, and researchers must choose a specific kind of graph and the features within the graph. Our project aims to identify possible shortcomings in current circuit representations and suggest possible improvements, which will allow for deeper and more accurate research in the future.
